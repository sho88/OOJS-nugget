# OOJS-nugget
Just some basic JS nugget stuff I know of in ES5. There's more to show, but this should be a decent start.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have git installed (of course!), and in your preferred cli terminal, type the following:

```
- git clone https://github.com/sho88/OOJS-nugget.git
- cd OOJS-nugget
- open index.html (for windows users, just type: "index.html")
```
